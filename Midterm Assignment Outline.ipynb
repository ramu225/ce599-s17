    "* Who makes the decision\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The relationship between the two\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Why the relationship has an effect on the results\n",
    "    \n",
    "* What has happened in previous forecasts (were they good or bad)\n",

    "**Issues with the forecasting** \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Inherent error in our forecasts (due to assumptions and the nature of irrational human behavior being involved in modeling traffic demand. \n",
    "    * Link back to the other fields and how their forecasts have not panned out well (economic)\n",
    "    * Talk about the assumptions that have to be made\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The planner becoming an advocate for an alternative or objective (due to political push or personal gain)\n",
    "    * link back to the global warming forecasts \n",
    "    * link back to construction scheduling and polictical push to finish a schedule on time leading to matienance issues or worse reowork. \n",

    "* Structure the organization with one position being a middle man between the executives and the engineers\n",
    "    * Make sure he can understand technical language and interpret it in lamemans terms \n",
    "    * Provides a means for somebody being held responsible for any issues with advocacy towards an outcome for the model\n",
    "    * This will ultimately be an arbitrator for the two parties\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Get the federal regulators to mandate reviews of travel demand forecasts every so many years \n",
    "    * Provides multiple examples of models that have worked well and reasons why the others failed\n",
    "    * Force the executive to think twice about pushing their agenda\n",
    "    * Not meant to be as a \"gotcha\" more of a \"lessons learned\" unless blatent  \n",

    "** Conclusion**\n",
    "* Reiterate the issues that traffic demand modeling has. \n",
    "* Provide the reasoning behind the solutions\n",
    "* wrap everything up and give a good feeling of hope for traffic demand modeling \n"
