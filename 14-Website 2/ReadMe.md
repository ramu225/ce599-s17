Group time to make class webpage.  

The page should: 

1. Have a basic intro to what the class is about. 
2. Feature each student and the instructor with a picture and a blurb. 
3. Feature each of your term projects with an image and description. Include a placeholder if you are still deciding. 
4. Be appropriate for public consumption. 
5. Look polishedâ€”this is a chance to show off.
